## Conclusion

This roadmap prioritizes foundational improvements first, followed by high-impact query capabilities, then user experience enhancements. The 12-month timeline is aggressive but achievable with proper resource allocation. The modular nature of the plans allows for parallel development in later phases and provides flexibility to adjust based on user feedback and changing priorities.
