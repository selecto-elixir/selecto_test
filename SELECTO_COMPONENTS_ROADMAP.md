## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Process
1. **Feature Branches**: Create feature branches for each major component
2. **Testing**: Write tests alongside implementation
3. **Documentation**: Update docs as features are completed
4. **Review**: Code review before merging to main

### Technical Considerations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure no breaking changes to existing implementations
- **Performance**: Monitor performance impact, especially for large datasets
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- **Mobile First**: Design responsive components from the start
- **Colocated Hooks**: Use Phoenix LiveView 1.1+ colocated hooks pattern

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each new component
- Integration tests for feature interactions
- Visual regression testing for UI changes
- Performance benchmarks for data-heavy features

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Core Enhancements)
- [ ] 100% of errors (all types) are properly displayed and categorized
- [ ] Debug information respects domain configuration 100% of the time
- [ ] Zero sensitive data exposure in production mode
- [ ] Error recovery success rate >80% for transient errors
- [ ] Developer debugging time reduced by 60% with enhanced error details
- [ ] Table sorting/filtering reduces data exploration time by 50%
- [ ] Mobile usage increases by 30%
- [ ] Export feature used by 40% of users

### Phase 2 (Advanced Interactions)

- [ ] Form completion rate increases by 40%
- [ ] Filter panel adoption reaches 70%

### Phase 3 (UI/UX Polish)
- [ ] User satisfaction score increases by 25%

- [ ] Subselect builder reduces complex query time by 70%

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance degradation**: Implement virtual scrolling early
- **Breaking changes**: Maintain backward compatibility layer
- **Browser compatibility**: Test on all major browsers

### Resource Risks
- **Timeline slippage**: Prioritize HIGH priority items
- **Scope creep**: Stick to documented requirements
- **Dependencies**: Coordinate with Selecto core updates

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Phoenix LiveView 1.1+ (for colocated hooks)
- Alpine.js (for interactive components)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Chart.js or similar (for enhanced graphs)

### Internal Dependencies
- Selecto core (for query building)
- SelectoDome (for data manipulation)
- SelectoMix (for code generation)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Set up feature branch structure
   - Create test harness for new components
   - Begin Phase 1.1 (Enhanced Table Presentation)

2. **Communication**
   - Weekly progress updates
   - Demo sessions after each phase
   - Gather user feedback continuously

3. **Documentation**
   - API documentation for each component
   - Usage examples and best practices
   - Migration guide for existing users

## Notes

- Some features from the plans may already be partially implemented
- Priority and effort estimates should be validated with the team
- Timeline assumes 1-2 developers working on implementation
- Consider creating a prototype/demo app to showcase new features
