# COMPTASK-0099: Fix Debug Panel Clipboard Functionality

## Status: Complete
## Priority: LOW
## Effort: 2 hours
## Phase: 1.2
## Week: 2

## Description
Fix the clipboard copy functionality in the debug panel. The colocated JavaScript hook is properly defined but the copy button is not working as expected.

## Current State
- Colocated hook `.DebugClipboard` is defined in `SelectoComponents.Debug.DebugDisplay`
- Hook is being extracted during compilation to `_build/dev/phoenix-colocated/`
- Button is currently hidden with `:if={false}` to prevent user confusion
- Copy functionality includes modern clipboard API with fallback

## Technical Requirements
- Debug why the colocated hook is not being properly registered/loaded
- Ensure the hook is accessible to the LiveView JavaScript runtime
- Verify event handling between server and client
- Test clipboard functionality across different browsers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Copy button successfully copies SQL to clipboard
- [ ] Visual feedback shows when copy succeeds or fails
- [ ] Works with both parameterized and interpolated SQL views
- [ ] Functions correctly in development and production environments

## Implementation Notes
- Check if the hook needs to be imported in app.js
- Verify the event push/handle mechanism is working
- Consider if the hook name format needs adjustment
- May need to review Phoenix LiveView colocated hooks documentation
