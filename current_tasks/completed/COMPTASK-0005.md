# COMPTASK-0005: Error Recovery Mechanisms

## Status: Completed & Verified
## Verified: 2025-09-15
## Completion Date: 2025-09-10
## Priority: CRITICAL
## Effort: 1 day
## Phase: 1.1
## Week: 1

## Description
Implement retry mechanisms and recovery strategies for transient errors, allowing users to recover from temporary failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Identify retryable error types
- [x] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Add retry button to error display
- [x] Preserve form state during retries
- [x] Limit retry attempts
- [x] Show retry status to user
- [x] Provide alternative actions when retry fails

## Technical Requirements
- Error type detection for retryable errors
- Exponential backoff implementation
- State preservation during retries
- Retry counter and limits

## Files to Create/Modify
- `vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/error_handling/error_recovery.ex` (new)
- `vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/error_handling/error_display.ex` (modify)
- `vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/form.ex` (modify)

## Dependencies
- COMPTASK-0001 (Error display foundation)

## Testing Requirements
- Test retry logic
- Test exponential backoff
- Test retry limits
- Test state preservation
- Test with various error types

## Notes
- Only retry truly transient errors
- Consider user experience during retries
- Avoid infinite retry loops

## Implementation Summary
- Created `SelectoComponents.ErrorHandling.ErrorRecovery` module with comprehensive retry logic
- Implemented exponential backoff with configurable limits (max 3 attempts, backoff from 1s to 16s)
- Added error classification to identify retryable errors (timeout, connection, network, etc.)
- Integrated retry button into ErrorDisplay component for retryable errors
- Added retry status component showing progress and allowing cancellation
- Implemented state preservation and restoration for form data during retries
- Provided "Try Again" and "Dismiss" options when retries are exhausted
