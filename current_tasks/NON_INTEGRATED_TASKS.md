# Non-Integrated SelectoComponents Tasks

## Overview
These tasks have been completed (components exist) but are NOT yet integrated into the main SelectoComponents Form. They need integration work to be fully functional.

## Non-Integrated Completed Tasks

### High Priority Integration Needs

1. **COMPTASK-0010: Virtual Scrolling for Large Datasets** ‚ùå FAILED
   - Status: Component exists at `enhanced_table/virtualization.ex`
   - Integration attempted but failed due to architectural mismatch
   - Problems: Large whitespace, only shows 16 rows, doesn't update on scroll
   - Note: The Virtualization component is incompatible with current Detail view architecture
   - Recommendation: Use pagination or implement simpler infinite scroll approach

2. **COMPTASK-0014: Modal Detail View from Row Click** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Status: Fully integrated
   - Row click handlers and modal rendering implemented in Detail view
   - Impact: Improves UX for drilling into records

3. **COMPTASK-0015: Inline Editing in Tables**
   - Status: Components exist at `enhanced_table/inline_edit.ex` and `edit_cell.ex`
   - Integration needed: Enable edit mode in Detail view table cells
   - Impact: Allows direct data manipulation

4. **COMPTASK-0024: Subselect UI Components** üóëÔ∏è REMOVED
   - Status: Components removed from codebase (available in git history)
   - Decision: Removed for reconsideration of approach
   - Impact: Will revisit complex nested query UI in future

5. **COMPTASK-0025: CTE Visualization and Management** üóëÔ∏è REMOVED
   - Status: Components removed from codebase (available in git history)
   - Decision: Removed for reconsideration of approach
   - Impact: Will revisit CTE builder UI in future

### Medium Priority Integration Needs

6. **COMPTASK-0004: View State Serialization**
   - Status: Component exists (mentioned in previous work)
   - Integration needed: Enable save/load of view configurations
   - Impact: Allows sharing and persisting views

7. **COMPTASK-0005: Query Performance Metrics** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Status: Fully integrated
   - Metrics collector running and telemetry integrated with LiveDashboard
   - Impact: Helps optimize slow queries

8. **COMPTASK-0013: Saved Filter Sets** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Status: Fully integrated
   - Filter save/load UI added to filter panel
   - Impact: Reusable filter configurations

9. **COMPTASK-0016: Quick Add Forms**
   - Status: Components exist at `forms/quick_add.ex` and `inline_form.ex`
   - Integration needed: Add "Quick Add" button to toolbar
   - Impact: Streamlines data entry

10. **COMPTASK-0017: Bulk Actions Interface**
    - Status: Components exist at `enhanced_table/bulk_actions.ex` and `row_selection.ex`
    - Integration needed: Add selection checkboxes and bulk action dropdown
    - Impact: Enables batch operations

11. **COMPTASK-0023: Shareable View Links** üóëÔ∏è REMOVED
    - Status: Components removed from codebase (available in git history)
    - Decision: Removed for reconsideration of approach
    - Impact: Will revisit view sharing UI in future

12. **COMPTASK-0026: Performance Monitoring Dashboard** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
    - Status: Fully integrated
    - Performance metrics integrated with Phoenix LiveDashboard
    - Impact: Query optimization insights available in /dev/dashboard

### Low Priority Integration Needs

13. **COMPTASK-0018: Theme System and CSS Variables**
    - Status: Components exist at `theme/theme_provider.ex` and `theme_switcher.ex`
    - Integration needed: Add theme switcher to UI and apply theme classes
    - Impact: Customizable appearance

14. **COMPTASK-0022: URL Shortening Service** üóëÔ∏è REMOVED
    - Status: Components removed from codebase (available in git history)
    - Decision: Removed for reconsideration of approach
    - Impact: Will revisit URL shortening in future

## Integration Recommendations

### Quick Wins (1-2 hours each)
- ~~Virtual Scrolling (COMPTASK-0010)~~ ‚ùå Failed - architectural incompatibility
- ~~Query Performance Metrics (COMPTASK-0005)~~ ‚úÖ Completed - Integrated with LiveDashboard
- Shareable View Links (COMPTASK-0023) - Add share button

### Medium Effort (4-8 hours each)
- Modal Detail View (COMPTASK-0014) - Row click handlers and modal state
- Saved Filter Sets (COMPTASK-0013) - UI for save/load operations
- Bulk Actions (COMPTASK-0017) - Selection state management

### Significant Effort (1-2 days each)
- Inline Editing (COMPTASK-0015) - Complex state management
- ~~Subselect UI (COMPTASK-0024)~~ üóëÔ∏è Removed - Will reconsider approach
- ~~CTE Visualization (COMPTASK-0025)~~ üóëÔ∏è Removed - Will reconsider approach

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize based on user needs
2. Start with quick wins for immediate value
3. Consider creating integration tasks for each component
4. Test thoroughly as features are integrated
5. Update documentation as features go live

## Notes
- All components are already built and tested individually
- Integration mainly involves wiring up the UI and state management
- Some features may need minor adjustments to work together
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
